# ESP32 Alexa PC Power Control

This project uses an ESP32 with the Espalexa library to turn a PC on and off via Alexa voice commands. It works by connecting the ESP32 to the PCâ€™s power switch pins on the motherboard.

## How It Works

- The ESP32 connects to WiFi and registers as an Alexa-compatible device.
- Alexa commands trigger a simulated power button press on the PC.
- An optocoupler reads the PCâ€™s power status to determine if itâ€™s on or off.
- The status LED reflects the current power state.
