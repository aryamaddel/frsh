# My Personal Blog (Nuxt Content Starter)

This is my personal blog built with Nuxt.js. While it’s currently empty, it's set up as a great starting point for any content-driven site using **Nuxt Content**.

## Features

- **Nuxt Content** for managing and rendering content
- **Nuxt Image** for optimized image handling
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **Tailwind CSS Typography** for styled text content

## Installation

It’s recommended to use **Bun** for faster installs and better performance, but **npm** works fine as well.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   - With Bun:
     ```bash
     bun install
     ```
   - Or with NPM:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
3. Run the development server:
   - With Bun (to use Bun’s runtime instead of Node.js):
     ```bash
     bun run dev --bun
     ```
   - Or with NPM:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
